.Dt ASF 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm asf
.Nd add symbol files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl afKksVx
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Fl X Ar suffix
.Op Ar modules-path Op Ar outfile
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
The
.Nm
utility is not present in
.Fx 12.0
and later.
The
.Xr kgdb 1
debugger handles kernel module state internally.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
By default,
.Nm
reads
.Xr kldstat 8
output from standard input and writes to the
.Pa .asf
file a list of
.Xr gdb 1
commands to add symbol files from KLDs in subdirectories of the subdirectory
.Pa modules
of the current directory, which is intended to be a kernel build directory.
This allows
.Xr gdb 1
to load the symbols into the debugging environment.
.Pp
An optional
.Ar modules-path
argument can specify a semicolon-separated list of directory pathnames
similar to the
.Va kern.module_path
sysctl.
Each directory in the list will be searched in turn for modules.
The default list consists of just one element,
.Pa modules ,
which is suitable if the current directory is a kernel build directory.
.Pp
If
.Ar outfile
is specified,
.Nm
writes to it instead of
.Pa .asf .
If
.Ar outfile
is a single dash
.Pq Sq Fl ,
standard output is used.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options modify the function of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
When writing to an explicit
.Ar outfile ,
append to the file rather than overwriting it.
.It Fl f
Instead of trying to simplistically guess the path for each module, perform
a traversal in the same way that
.Xr find 1
does to locate an exact path for each module, no matter where in
.Ar modules-path
it is located.
.It Fl K
Instead of reading from standard input, use the conventional
system interface to get the list of modules currently loaded.
.It Fl k
Instead of reading from standard input, start a
.Xr kldstat 8
and read the information from it.
.It Fl M
Specify the core file for
.Xr kvm 3 .
Implies
.Fl V .
.It Fl N
Specify the system file for
.Xr kvm 3 .
Implies
.Fl V .
.It Fl o
Specify the file for
.Nm
to write or append its output to.
If
.Ar outfile
is a single dash
.Pq Sq Fl ,
standard output is used.
.It Fl s
Do not prepend a (guessed) subdirectory of the module path.
.It Fl V
Instead of reading from standard input, use the
.Xr kvm 3
interface to get the list of modules.
This interface allows for inspecting system crash dumps,
as well as the live system.
The
.Fl M
and
.Fl N
options will be of use if inspecting a crash dump.
Elevated privileges, e.g., those of a superuser,
may be needed to use this option.
.It Fl X
Add
.Ar suffix
to the list of suffixes
.Nm
tries to append to KLD file names.
The default list consists of
.Pa .debug ,
.Pa .symbols ,
and the null suffix.
The null suffix always stays at the list tail, after the suffix added.
Should it be needed in the middle of the list,
a blank suffix can be specified to
.Fl X
instead.
.It Fl x
Clear the list of suffixes
.Nm
tries to append to KLD file names.
Only the null suffix is left in the list.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To add symbol files from the system search path specified by the
.Va kern.module_path
sysctl, the following command can be used:
.Pp
.Dl asf -s `sysctl -n kern.module_path`
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gdb 1 ,
.Xr kvm 3 ,
.Xr kld 4 ,
.Xr kldstat 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 5.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Greg Lehey Aq Mt grog@FreeBSD.org
.Sh BUGS
Module paths are guessed in a rather naive way by default.
It is likely to lag behind the changes to the build tree layout.
Using
.Fl f
is recommended.
