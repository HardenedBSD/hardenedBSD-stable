	Change pax_get_prison(...) to pax_get_prison_td(...) where possible.
	Fix one segvguard related issue.
	Changed pax_elf signature.

	We reverted this code in version 37, because we observed weird
	issue, but this issues was unrelated to the reworked internals.
	The true root of the problem was a secadm bug and the issue fixed
	with version 38.


[20151218] reworked MAP_32BIT mmap randomization

	Move the mmap randomization to it's own place and add more state enforcements (KASSERTs).
	Added locking around pax_aslr_mmap(...).
	Factore out the MAP_32BIT related code from pax_aslr_mmap(...), and move to pax_aslr_mmap_map_32bit(...)

[20150408] How to get HardenedBSD and HardenedBSD-ports?

	Without git/svnlite:

	    HardenedBSD source:

		# fetch https://github.com/HardenedBSD/hardenedBSD/archive/hardened/current/master.tar.gz -o hardenedbsd-src.tar.gz
		# tar xf hardenedbsd-src.tar.gz
		# mv hardenedBSD-hardened-current-master /usr/src

	    HardenedBSD ports:

		# fetch https://github.com/HardenedBSD/freebsd-ports/archive/master.tar.gz -o hardenedbsd-ports.tar.gz
		# tar xf hardenedbsd-ports.tar.gz
		# mv freebsd-ports-master /usr/ports

	    Secadm:

		# fetch https://github.com/HardenedBSD/secadm/archive/master.tar.gz -o secadm.tar.gz
		# tar xf secadm.tar.gz

	With git:

	    HardenedBSD-source:

		# git clone https://github.com/HardenedBSD/hardenedBSD.git /usr/src

	    HardenedBSD ports:

		# git clone https://github.com/HardenedBSD/freebsd-ports.git /usr/ports

	    Secadm:

		# git clone https://github.com/HardenedBSD/secadm.git

	With svnlite (much more slower than git version):

	    HardenedBSD-source:

		# svnlite co https://github.com/HardenedBSD/hardenedBSD.git /usr/src

	    HardenedBSD ports:

		# svnlite co https://github.com/HardenedBSD/freebsd-ports.git /usr/ports

	    Secadm:

		# svnlite co https://github.com/HardenedBSD/secadm.git


[20150404] Added secadm hook to rtld
__HardenedBSD_version = 18

Added integriforce secadm hook to rtld to validate
shared object before loading them.
Warning: The integriforce hook currently not
supported in HardenedBSD 10-STABLE branch.


[20150318] Merged first part of NOEXEC project
__HardenedBSD_version = 17

This is the first part of PaX's MPROTECT restriction:
* this merge brings per process level restriction settings
* eliminated the linux's sound related mmap weakness
* improved the logging
...

If you have problem with your application, then install
secadm:

 * from pkg:

	pkg install secadm

 * or from github:

	# git clone https://github.com/hardenedbsd/secadm
	# cd secadm
	# make && make install


[201502011] Changed kernel knobs

Added ``options PAX`` to enable the HardenedBSD framework.
All other PAX_* knob depends on PAX knob.


[20150131] Upgrading from systems before "HBSD: Revert the chacha20 import in full."

After the "HBSD: Revert the chacha20 import in full." commit
we lost the compatibility with the previous version, this
means ABI break, and the system is unable to properly boot.
In the background is the removed VM_INHERIT_ZERO flag, which
was previously used in libc.

The solution is to install the new world, before you booting to the new kernel.

1. make buildworld kernel
2. IMPORTANT: install world before you reboot
 2.1. mergemaster -p && make installworld && mergemaster
3. reboot
4. start in single user mode
5. cd /usr/src
6. make delete-old delete-old-libs
7. if you have buildworld or buildkernel error,
   where the cc aborting and dumping core,
   then you need to delete the content of /usr/obj directory:
 7.1 cd /usr/obj
 7.2 rm -rf *

And probably a full ports rebuild required too...
